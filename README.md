# ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-2014-EFI

This repository is meant to guide others who wish to configure an OpenCore EFI for their X1 Carbon 2nd gen, which to my knowledge hasn't been documented yet.

Ideally you would refer to this repo as a device-specific companion to [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) and manually download the latest releases of the kernel extensions (kext) compiled here. But if you choose to download this repo directly you should be able to boot once you've configured your BOOT directory with the desired Mac OS version.
